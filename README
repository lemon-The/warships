This project has made for educational purposes. You may do whatever you
want with it.

Description
===========
Command line application for sea battles and warships management

Preparations
============
Before running the program you need to make some settings:
    1) Create postgres data base and run commands from ddl.sql file to
        create tables
    2) Run commands from dml.sql to populate data base
    3) In './jdbc.properties' file enter your data base name and
        data base user and his password
    4) In 'start.sh' script enter path to .jar
    5) Run 'start.sh'
'jdbc.properties' file is needed to get access to your postgres data base.
And 'start.sh' enables autocompletion (to get more information about
autocompletion see: 'https://picocli.info/autocomplete.html')

Usage
=====
You can see/manipulate battles and battle members information by using
add/delete/modify/show subcommands (use --help for more information).
Example:
    warships show members list
